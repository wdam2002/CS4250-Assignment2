## Overview
This project provides a menu-driven interface to interact with a MongoDB database. It allows users to create, update, delete documents, and output an inverted index based on the terms in the documents. The program performs text analysis to count term occurrences, removes punctuation, and manages the documents in a MongoDB collection.
